# FPGA-Based-Image-Gradient-Processing
Designed a complex FPGA project involving memory generation, image gradient computation, and VGA display control. Utilized Vivadoâ€™s memory generator to store and access image data, implemented image gradient operations, and displayed the transformed images on a VGA monitor. The project showcases the integration of memory modules, image processing algorithms, and display controller design on the Basys 3 board using VHDL.
